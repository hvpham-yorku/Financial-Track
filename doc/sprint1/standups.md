March 12, 2025 – Sprint #1 Standup #1 (7:00PM - 7:45PM)
1. We created the System Design document and began adding CRC cards. Basic login was set up – changes need to be uploaded to Github. Skeleton of front-end with login is completed but back-end implementation is not ready yet.
2. Committing to splitting up the work between the team with Matt, Kwangmin and Daniel working on the back-end. Yashvir and Jay will work on the front end. 
Implementation of core functionality that was decided in Sprint 0 is the main focus of Sprint 1.
Work to be done on the CRC cards, architecture diagram and front-end refinement by implementing the calendar view with both monthly and weekly views, as well as the process of adding inflows and outflows.
3. The coding part is expected to be finished by the end of the week, with a meeting on Friday to go over any blockers that come up and another meeting on Monday or Tuesday to refine and finalize outstanding implementations. 
4. As this is the first meeting, no blockers have been brought up yet as each team member familiarized themselves with the sprint 1 requirements and implemented certain features that they had time for.
