  - Individuals who prefer **manual** budget tracking over automated bank syncing.  
  - Users looking for a **privacy-first** financial tracker.

  - **Simplicity and privacy** are often overlooked in favor of feature-heavy designs.  

- **What Would It Take for Competitors to Catch Up?**  
  - They would need to **strip down their interfaces** and remove bank integration features, which is unlikely given their business models.  
  - They would need to **introduce manual tracking modes**, which could complicate their current automation-focused design.
