# Sprint 0 Process Reflection

## Team Collaboration

We worked effectively together since we maintained an open communication, which ensured that everyone was on the same page. We met once on Discord Voice Chat to discuss the project and how to divide the tasks equally among each other. Each member was responsible for something different such as personas, user stories, and setup.

## Decision Making

Our decisions were made as a team and everyone's opinions and ideas were heard. This ensured that all members felt included and felt that their opinions were valued. We did not take any votes, we all agreed through natural conversations.

## Meeting Frequency

We met three times during this sprint, but we realized that meeting more frequently and in a more organised way would have been beneficial. Regular meetings would help us stay aligned with our goals and discuss any issues quickly and efficiently.

Overall, our initial sprint was a valuable learning experience, and we are confident that the lessons learned will help us improve in the next phases of the project.
